### ``Word is a word embedding model?``
<img align="right" width="261.75" height="228" src="/assets/flamenco-downloading-1.png">

Word embedding is one of the most popular representation of document vocabulary. It is capable of capturing context of a word in a document, semantic and syntactic similarity, relation with other words, etc.

### ``Ok But Where is here then?``

Hmm not very important but maybe the only place you can find all word embedding for Persian to ``Train`` or just download the ``Pretrained`` version and of course one important thing is that, here I collect current best Models (2019) and I made a ``Lite`` version of them to use in your JS or Android or C# or ... Application without using Online API or...

> Important note: some models currently have pretrained version for Persian so I just made them lite
